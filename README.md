## <strong>Idea: </strong>
To create a portal for companies to come and register and request other companies to Collab so that they can  Collab with others.

Once both of them show Mutual Interests to colab, we show help them view Hotels and Airports based on Date and Location


And all these meetings are  even given out as Data for other bussinesses to consume for example Media Houses, Tech Bloggers, Tech Enthusiasts and other common Audience



## <strong>Implemented So Far</strong>

The M2M Relational Companies Models along with CRUD Operations
#### Consumption of 2 Services
#### Exposing of 2 Services

## <strong> Difficulties Faced :</strong>
Hotel Booking and Flight Booking required us to Comply with Certain â€¯PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) which we were not aware of and neither had similar experience, hence payment was not integrated along with the booking of flights and hotels.

## <strong> Conclusion:</strong>
We felt the project idea to be Ambitious and intrigued us a lot and made us learn alot about the intricacies of Django and Web Development as a whole. This is something which could be taken up as an amazing pet project to bring into production during our summers to make it a full blown feature rich Web App with all the bells and whistles.
